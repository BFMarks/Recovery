			<string>DocuSign Objc Client LICENSE
This is an agreement between You ("You") and DocuSign Corporation, located at 1301 Second Avenue, Suite 2000, Seattle, WA 98101, ("DocuSign") regarding Your use of the DocuSign Objc Client and any associated documentation, software code or other materials made available by DocuSign (collectively referred to in this agreement as the "DocuSign Objc Client").  The DocuSign Objc Client includes documentation for one or more DocuSign application programming interfaces (collectively the "APIs"), which may be further defined in API-specific Terms of Use ("TOU"), and any software code provided by DocuSign in conjunction with such documentation.  The DocuSign Objc Client is made available by DocuSign to assist developers in integrating certain functionality of the DocuSign services made available through the APIs (the "Services") into applications.  This agreement applies to any updates, supplements or support services for the DocuSign Objc Client, unless other terms accompany those items.  If so, those other terms apply.
By installing, accessing or otherwise using the DocuSign Objc Client, You accept the terms of this agreement.  If You do not agree to the terms of this agreement, do not install, access or use the DocuSign Objc Client or the APIs. 
If You comply with this agreement, You have the rights below. 
(1)	USE OF THE DocuSign Objc Client. Subject to Your compliance with this agreement, DocuSign hereby authorizes You to use the DocuSign Objc Client solely for the purpose of creating applications designed to operate with the Services (referred to as "Authorized Applications").  You may not rent, lease or lend any of Your rights in the DocuSign Objc Client or access to the Services.  You may make a reasonable number of copies of the DocuSign Objc Client for the purposes set forth herein, provided that You reproduce only complete copies, including without limitation all "read me" files, copyright notices, and other legal notices and terms that DocuSign has included in the DocuSign Objc Client, and provided that You may not distribute any copy, partial or complete, You make of the DocuSign Objc Client.  Your Authorized Applications: will include functionality that enables end users to access and use all features available through the Services; will not include any independent features or functionality that are substantially similar to or compete with the functionality available through the Services; and will not provide access to or promote any services that are substantially similar to or compete with the Services. 
(2)	SCOPE OF LICENSE. The DocuSign Objc Client is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives You some rights to use the DocuSign Objc Client.  DocuSign reserves all other rights.  DocuSign specifically does not grant any express or implied rights under its patents with respect to your Authorized Applications.  Unless applicable law gives You more rights despite this limitation, You may use the DocuSign Objc Client only as expressly permitted in this agreement.  In doing so, You must comply with any technical limitations in the DocuSign Objc Client that only allow You to use it in certain ways.  You may not: (a) reverse engineer, decompile, distribute or disassemble the DocuSign Objc Client, except and only to the extent that applicable law expressly permits, despite this limitation; or (b) make more copies of the DocuSign Objc Client than specified in this agreement, except and only to the extent applicable law expressly permits, despite this limitation; or (c) publish the DocuSign Objc Client for others to copy; or (d) rent, lease or lend the DocuSign Objc Client.
(3)	USE OF THE SERVICES. Your use of the Services, and the use of the Services by anyone hosting or using your Authorized Application, is governed by the then-current TOU which can be found on: https://www.docusign.net.
(4)	EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE DocuSign Objc Client IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.  YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO THE DocuSign Objc Client.  THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.
(5)	SUPPORT. DocuSign is not obligated to provide any technical or other support ("Support Services") for the DocuSign Objc Client or Services to You.  However, if DocuSign chooses to provide any Support Services to You, Your use of such Support Services will be governed by then-current DocuSign policies.  With respect to any technical or other information You provide to DocuSign in connection with the Support Services, You agree that DocuSign has an unrestricted right to use such information for its business purposes, including for product support and development. DocuSign will not use such information in a form that personally identifies You.
(6) 	FEEDBACK. By submitting feedback to DocuSign at NuGetPackage@docusign.com: (a) You automatically grant to DocuSign a perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, royalty-free license to use Your feedback for any and all purposes without any compensation to You; and (b) You agree that You will not publish, submit, or display feedback You submit to or on any other web site or in any other publicly accessible forum without DocuSign's prior written consent.
(7) 	LICENSED MARKS. DocuSign hereby grants You a limited, revocable, nonexclusive and nontransferable right to use DocuSign's regular trade names, trademarks, titles and logos ("Licensed Marks") solely for purposes of identifying DocuSign's products and services. Details of this trademark license are available at: http://www.docusign.com/IP.
(8)	FEES. DocuSign may choose in the future to charge for use of the DocuSign Objc Client, the APIs and/or Services.  If DocuSign in its sole discretion chooses to establish fees and payment terms for such use, DocuSign will provide notice of such terms as provided in Section 10 below, and You may elect to stop using the DocuSign Objc Client, APIs and/or Services rather than incurring fees.
(9)	TERMINATION. DocuSign reserves the right to discontinue offering the DocuSign Objc Client, APIs and Services or to modify the DocuSign Objc Client, APIs or Services at any time in its sole discretion.  If You are dissatisfied with any aspect of the DocuSign Objc Client, APIs or Services at any time, Your sole and exclusive remedy is to cease using them.  Notwithstanding anything contained in the agreement to the contrary, DocuSign may also, in its sole discretion, terminate or suspend access to the APIs and Services to You or any end user at any time.  You acknowledge that termination and/or monetary damages may not be a sufficient remedy if You breach this agreement and that DocuSign will be entitled, without waiving any other rights or remedies, to injunctive or equitable relief as may be deemed proper by a court of competent jurisdiction in the event of a breach.  This Section and Sections 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 will survive termination of this agreement or any discontinuation of the offering of the DocuSign Objc Client, APIs or Services, along with any other provisions that would reasonably be deemed to survive such events.
(10)	RESERVATION OF RIGHTS. Except for the licenses expressly granted under this agreement, DocuSign and its suppliers retain all right, title and interest in and to the DocuSign Objc Client, APIs, Services, and all intellectual property rights therein.  You are not authorized to alter, modify, copy, edit, format, create derivative works of or otherwise use any materials, content or technology provided under this agreement except as explicitly provided in this agreement or approved in advance in writing by DocuSign.
(11)	MODIFICATIONS; NOTICES. If we change this contract, then we will give you notice before the change is in force.  If you do not agree to these changes, then you must cancel and stop using the DocuSign Objc Client, Services and APIs before the changes are in force.  If you do not stop using the DocuSign Objc Client, Services or APIs, then your use of the DocuSign Objc Client, Services or APIs will continue under the changed contract.  DocuSign may give notices to You, at DocuSign's option, by posting on any portion of https://docusign.net or by electronic mail to any e-mail address provided by You to DocuSign.
(12)	ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and any applicable TOU or contract for Services, are the entire agreement with respect to the DocuSign Objc Client, the Services and the APIs.
(13)	APPLICABLE LAW AND VENUE 
Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles.  The laws of the state where You live govern all other claims, including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort.  You agree that any action brought under this agreement will be subject to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts located in Seattle, Washington.
(14)	LEGAL EFFECT. This agreement describes certain legal rights.  You may have other rights under the laws of Your country.  This agreement does not change Your rights under the laws of Your country if the laws of Your country do not permit it to do so.
(15)	DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. The DocuSign Objc Client is licensed "as-is." You bear the risk of using it.  DocuSign gives no express or implied warranties, guarantees or conditions.  You may have additional consumer rights under Your local laws which this agreement cannot change.  To the extent permitted under Your local laws, DocuSign excludes the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.  DocuSign does not represent or warrant that the DocuSign Objc Client or the Services will always be available, uninterrupted, secure, or error free. 
(16)	LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. You can recover from DocuSign and its suppliers only direct damages up to U.S. $5.00.  You cannot recover any other damages, including consequential, lost profits, special, indirect or incidental damages.  This limitation applies to: 
     (a)	anything related to the DocuSign Objc Client, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and 
     (b)	claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law. 
It applies even if DocuSign knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages.  The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to You because Your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.

      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
